# spotify-ts-api

_semi-aggressively typed API library for interfacing with the Spotify Web API._

_Status: initial boilerplate / placeholder_

## Note

- Not tested. I do not know how to write tests in JavaScript / TypeScript yet
- A lot of the interfaces file can be consolidated

I wonder if the type files in this repo could be transpiled into C# source code though...
